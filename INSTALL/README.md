# INSTALL Documentation for the MISP Project.

To have a more web friendly view please visit the mkdocs generated gh-pages site [here](https://misp.github.io/MISP/)

Currently the following install guides are being tested on a regular basis:
```
INSTALL.ubuntu2404.sh
```

Files prefixed with 'CONFIG.' are CONFIGuration guides and not full blown INSTALL guides.

UPGRADE.ubuntu2404.sh upgrades an existing MISP 2.4 installation to 2.5, provided you are on ubuntu 24.04 (if you are on an earlier distribution, make sure you run a distribution upgrade first).

UPDATE.md gives you a brief overview on how to update MISP to the latest version, as well as some other core dependencies that can be updated.

Install guides with the 'x' prefix, are marked as Experimental.
